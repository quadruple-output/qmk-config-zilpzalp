- activate NKRO? (try CMD-SHFT-F10)
- M3: prefer hold for other half; always tap for same part
- hold-time für combos verlängert (try `;`)
- for columnar combos, increase hold time significantly (I don't thik that this hits the point.)
- change combos from columns to rows (or offer both?)
- realize M3 & M4 as combos (hold-only)
